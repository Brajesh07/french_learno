## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```
# Firebase Client Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

## Major Errors Encountered & Solutions

### 1. Firebase Admin SDK Private Key Decoder Error

**Error:** `error:1E08010C:DECODER routines::unsupported`

**Problem:** Firebase Admin SDK failed to parse the private key from environment variables due to formatting issues with newline characters and escape sequences.

**Solution:**

- Moved from environment variable approach to JSON service account file
- Created `firebase-service-account.json` with properly formatted credentials
- Updated `firebase-admin.ts` to use `cert(serviceAccountPath)` instead of individual credential fields
- This resolved all decoder errors and enabled proper Firebase Admin functionality

### 2. Email Mismatch in Admin Authentication

**Error:** "Email mismatch in admin record" (HTTP 403)

**Problem:** The email stored in the Firestore admin document didn't match the email in Firebase Authentication, causing login failures even with valid credentials.

**Solution:**

- Created debug API endpoints to identify the mismatch
- Implemented automatic email synchronization between Firebase Auth and Firestore
- Updated admin document with correct email from Firebase Authentication
- Added proper error handling and logging for future email mismatches

### 3. Port Conflicts During Development

**Error:** Port 3000 already in use

**Problem:** Multiple Next.js development servers running simultaneously causing port conflicts.

**Solution:**

- Implemented proper process cleanup with `pkill -f "next dev"`
- Added port checking and cleanup in development workflow
- Used `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9` to forcefully clear port usage

### 4. Firebase Project Configuration

**Problem:** Initial Firebase project setup and service account generation.

**Solution:**

- Created Firebase project "french-48cbf"
- Generated service account with proper permissions
- Enabled Firestore database with appropriate security rules
- Set up Firebase Authentication with admin user creation

## Security Implementations

1. **Firebase Security Rules** - Configured Firestore rules for admin-only access
2. **Session Cookies** - HTTPOnly cookies for secure session management
3. **Route Protection** - Middleware-based route protection for admin pages
4. **Token Verification** - Server-side ID token verification using Firebase Admin SDK
5. **Environment Security** - Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables and excluded from version control

## API Endpoints Created

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Admin authentication
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Session termination
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Token verification
- `GET /api/auth/list-users` - Debug endpoint for user listing
- `GET /api/auth/setup-admin` - Admin user setup
- Various debug endpoints for troubleshooting

## Database Schema

### Admins Collection

```typescript
{
  email: string
  role: 'admin'
  name: string
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
  lastLoginAt?: Date
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloudinary Integration** - For image/media management
2. **Email Notifications** - Automated email system for student communications
3. **Analytics Dashboard** - Learning progress tracking and reporting
4. **Multi-language Support** - Interface localization
5. **Advanced User Roles** - Instructor and student role management

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup:** `npm install` - Install dependencies
2. **Development:** `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
3. **Environment:** Configure `.env.local` with Firebase credentials
4. **Firebase:** Place service account JSON in project root
5. **Admin Setup:** Create admin user in Firebase Authentication
6. **Database:** Enable Firestore and configure security rules

## Lessons Learned

1. **Firebase Admin SDK:** JSON service account files are more reliable than environment variable credential parsing
2. **Authentication Flow:** Proper error handling and logging are crucial for debugging authentication issues
3. **Development Environment:** Process cleanup is essential when working with development servers
4. **Data Consistency:** Email synchronization between Firebase Auth and Firestore requires careful handling

## User creation & student fetch (steps and timestamp)

These are the concrete steps we performed to create/verify the admin user and to fetch the list of non-admin students; a fetch was executed during development on 24 August 2025.

Steps performed:

- Created and placed a valid Firebase service account JSON at the project root (`firebase-service-account.json`) so the Admin SDK could initialize correctly.
- Implemented `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts` to load the service account file via `cert(serviceAccountPath)` and export `adminAuth` and `adminDb`.
- Created the admin user in Firebase Authentication (email: `admin@frenchlearno.co`) via the Firebase console (or programmatically) and ensured the user exists in the `admins` Firestore collection. When the admin Firestore record was missing/mismatched we:
  - Added `GET /api/auth/setup-admin` and `GET /api/auth/fix-email` debug endpoints to create or sync the admin document from Firebase Auth.
  - Ran the setup endpoint which produced logs indicating the admin UID and the creation/verification of the Firestore admin document.
- Verified admin login flow in the React app by signing in with email/password, obtaining an ID token, and posting it to `POST /api/auth/login` which verifies the token server-side and creates a session cookie.

Student listing (what we ran):

- Endpoint used: `GET /api/admin/list-students` (protected)

  - Implementation: Uses `adminAuth.listUsers()` to page through Auth users, and for each user the endpoint checks `admins/{uid}` in Firestore; users with an admin document are skipped.
  - Returned fields per student: `{ uid, email, creationTime, lastSignInTime }`.

- Fetch performed (development): 24 August 2025 — server logs show the Admin SDK initialized and the students listing endpoint returned the results (example log: "Listing students from collection: admins" and "Users found: 3").

Notes on timestamps and exact log times:

- The dev server records precise timestamps in the terminal logs. For exact UTC/local times of each action (initialization, setup-admin, list-students fetch), check the terminal where `npm run dev` was run — the console entries near the fetch show the exact time and request details.

**Project Status:** ✅ Successfully Deployed and Functional
**Admin Login:** Available at `http://localhost:3000/login`
**Admin User:** `admin@frenchlearno.co`

## Individual Student Management (view & update) — 24 August 2025

### Endpoints Implemented

- `GET /api/admin/student/[uid]` — Fetches a single student's metadata from Firebase Auth and Firestore. Returns `{ uid, email, creationTime, lastSignInTime, isActive, hasSubscription }`.
- `PATCH /api/admin/student/[uid]` — Updates the student's Firestore record. Accepts `{ isActive, hasSubscription }` in the request body. Returns updated student data.

**Security:** Both endpoints require a valid admin session (ID token/session cookie). Unauthorized requests return 401.

### UI Implementation

- **Students Table:** In `/dashboard/students`, each row now has a "View" button linking to `/dashboard/students/[uid]`.
- **Student Detail Page:** At `/dashboard/students/[uid]`, the admin can:
  - View student metadata (email, creation time, last sign-in, etc.)
  - Toggle `isActive` and `hasSubscription` via switches, which call the PATCH endpoint
  - See real-time updates and error messages

**Workflow:**

1. Admin logs in and navigates to the Students table
2. Clicks "View" for a student to open their detail page
3. Can enable/disable the student or toggle subscription status
4. All changes are persisted to Firestore and reflected in the UI

**Testing:**

- Verified that only admins can access these endpoints and UI
- Confirmed PATCH updates are reflected in Firestore and UI state

**Timestamp:**

- Feature implemented and tested on 24 August 2025
